Software Developer | Passionate about Design and Front-End Development

Hello, I'm Anusmita Chanda, a recent graduate from Seneca College with a diploma in computer programming. I have a strong interest in design and front-end development, and I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects that combine creativity with technical skills.

My technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java, with experience in creating responsive and visually appealing web interfaces. While my focus has been on front-end development, I'm also familiar with Python, ASP.NET, and C++. Although I may consider myself a work in progress, I am determined to expand my knowledge and continuously grow as a developer.

Driven by a passion for designing things, I enjoy exploring the intersection of aesthetics and functionality to create delightful user experiences. I believe in the power of clean code, intuitive designs, and user-centric approaches to build robust applications.

I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that challenge me to expand my skills and contribute to meaningful solutions. If you're looking for a dedicated team player who brings a blend of design thinking and technical expertise, let's connect and discuss potential collaborations.
